# ml-examples-numpy-tensorflow

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This repository contains hands-on examples and code snippets to demonstrate key concepts using NumPy and TensorFlow.

The goal is to provide simple, clear examples for:

Understanding core NumPy operations (arrays, broadcasting, vectorization)

Building and training models with TensorFlow 2.x (dense layers, custom training loops, simple models)
